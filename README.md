# Simple English Dictionary Project

The English Dictionary project is a responsive React application designed with Tailwind CSS for a seamless user experience. The interface provides a clean layout that adapts gracefully to various screen sizes. Users can effortlessly look up word definitions through a well-designed input field. The app fetches real-time data from an API, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach contributes to the project's responsiveness, enabling fluid design adjustments. The dictionary not only displays definitions but also offers pronunciation assistance using the Speech Synthesis API. The integration of dynamic styles enhances the user interface, making it intuitive and aesthetically pleasing. Overall, this project demonstrates the synergy of React and Tailwind CSS in crafting a modern, responsive, and feature-rich English Dictionary application.
